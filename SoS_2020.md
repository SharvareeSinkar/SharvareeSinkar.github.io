### Project Overview

Summer of Science(SoS 2020) was conducted under Maths and Physics Club, IITB.This was a great opportunity for me to explore the research side of Physics and astronomy along with the Mathematics background.This indeed was a great experience and enjoyed a lot!

I always wanted to explore this topic.I have interest in Space-Time,Big-Bang and Cosmology.When forced to summarize,theory of
Relativity ,Albert Einstein said Space and Time and Gravitation have no other existence than Matter.
So,dive deep into the Majestic ocean with me to explore **The Special Theory of Relativity**.
