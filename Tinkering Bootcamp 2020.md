## Tinkering Bootcamp 
### Learner's Space 2020
'Tinkering Bootcamp' was organized by Tinkerer's Lab, under Learner's Space(by Career Cell,UGAC).
The duration of the bootcamp was nearly 5 weeks which comprised of various talks and related assignments.
The course aimed to familiarize the students with Arduino, Internet of things(IoT), RaspberryPi(RPi), Image processing via OpenCV,etc.
These devices are low-cost hardware that has a wide range of applications, primarily for student projects as well as some industrial implementation.

By the end of the course, I was well-versed with how the devices work, their applications (hardware and software) as well as was able to ideate on how to undertake projects. The course covered everything from coding to demonstrations of hardware implementation.

It taught simulation of devices on online platforms and how to install and code on IDEs, compatibility, and limitations of hardware used. All of the sessions were conducted live through video conferencing, and the recordings were made available to us immediately.
