## Consulting Bootcamp
### Learner's Space 2020

The consult club took me on a journey that begins with understanding the basics & had gone all the way to guide me on presenting the knowledge I've gained 
through it.
The course was an amazing chance to get started with consulting for all. It covered a thorough understanding of the basics followed by a real-world experience
in touch with assignments & interactive activities.
I,who had literally zero knowledge about Business, marketting or consulting,have now a considerable brief knowledge about the same.I got to learn a large no. of 
things which I otherwise would have not!

The flow of Bootcamp was as follows:

- Week 1: Introduction to Consulting and Guesstimates
- Week 2: Basics of Marketing and Market Analysis
- Week 3: Market Entry, Profitability and Competitor Analysis
- Week 4: Growth Strategy, Mergers and Acquisitions, Price and Pricing Strategy
- Week 5: Art of Storytelling, Presentation101, and Basics of Excel
