## Machine Learning
### Learner's Space 2020

A high-level introduction to the world of Machine Learning -one of the most promising paradigms of programming and its real world applications.

This course basically was a high-level introduction to Machine Learning - one of the most promising paradigms of programming. I began with brushing up the
coding skills in python and using required libraries. I then move on to regression and classification. Having developed an intuition of linear regression and 
its limitations, decision trees and random forests were be introduced. I understood about PCA, kNN and then jumped into neural net basics. 
An introduction to Unsupervised Learning and then the final hands-on experience on Neural Nets using frameworks like Tensorflow/Keras.
Meanwhile, a lot of practical aspects of ML were introduced along with the assignments/projects.

Week 1:
Python basics, Numpy, Matplotlib, Brushing of Linear Algebra, Calculus
Week 2 :
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
Pragmatics - Regularisation, Overfitting, Data Cleaning
Week 3 :
Mid-term Eval - in week 3 - Linear Regression on Titanic or some other dataset.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, PCA, kNN
Pragmatics - Data Distribution
Week 4:
Feedforward Neural Nets, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, Logic Gates using NNâ€™s
Pragmatics - Dropouts, Normalisation of Inputs, Initialization
Week 5 :
Tensorflow, Basic introduction to CNNs
Pragmatics - Optimizers
Week 6 :
Final Project using either of the frameworks.
Week 7 -
Final Evaluation - Build an end to end model and train it on a given dataset. Finally submit the accuracy of the model on the Test dataset. 
These will be used for evaluation. Then try and find more optimisation techniques for improving the accuracy. Special Mention to those with highest accuracy.
